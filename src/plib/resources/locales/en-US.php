If you have bought a domain name from a registrar and host your website at another hosting provider, you may need to point the domain name to your Plesk server. If your domain name is already pointing to Plesk, you may want to add additional third-party services (for example, mail or e-commerce platform) to your website. In both cases, you will have to configure DNS settings. This may be a challenging task, especially for a beginner. To accomplish this task easily, use the Domain Connect extension. Just provide the domain name, and the extension will automatically configure DNS settings for you.',
